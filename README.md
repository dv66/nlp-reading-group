# Celloscope NLP Paper Reading Group
We will read and present papers every week regularly. Everyone gets 10 minute for presentation. Summarize the paper into a ppt/pdf presentation. This will help us stay focused and aligned with cutting-edge NLP research and create motivation for our own research project.
